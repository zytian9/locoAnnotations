# How ``Loco'' is the LOCO Corpus? Annotating the Language of Conspiracy Theories

In this repo, we release the annotation of documents from two conspiracies: Sandry Hook and COVID. 
The documents are from the Language of Conspiracy Corpus (LOCO).
We developed an annotation scheme that will allow us to distinguish between documents containing conspiracy language and documents that do not contain any conspiracy content or that propagate conspiracy theories via misinformation. 
For the details, please see our paper: [How "Loco" is the LOCO Corpus? Annotating the Language of Conspiracy Theories](https://aclanthology.org/2022.law-1.14.pdf).
